This is a 2D OpenSCAD plan for a cutlery divider for a very specific drawer.

The only files kept reasonably up to date are dividers.scad and dividers.dxf.

# Dimension measurements

Drawer is 248x489mm (9.76x19.25in).

2nd set of measurements is 248-249, and 483-485. Difficult to make accurate measurements in such a long drawer without taking the drawer out.
Depth is 102mm.

# Requirements

3 columns: 2 split into 2 for forks and spoons, 1 left undivided, for table knives and long chopsticks.

# Market Research

Based on [Serious Eats Review of drawer organizers](https://www.seriouseats.com/best-kitchen-drawer-organizers-8421933):

- [Option 1](https://www.amazon.com/Joseph-85119-DrawerStore-Organizer-Silverware/dp/B072R6CLRC/) Target house has way too much cutlery to fit in this narrow option.
- [Example 1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B1CZVWR/): minimum width dimension is 9.8". It is theoretically possible to fit it by breaking off the expansion bit, but I'm not going to spend $22 to find out for sure.
- [Example 2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007B8RKJI): width dimension is 11".

Commercial versions appear to be 2.5-3in deep.

# Design considerations

[Ponoko article on kerf](https://help.ponoko.com/en/articles/4442594-how-much-material-does-the-laser-burn-away), for 3mm acrylic is 0.2mm.
